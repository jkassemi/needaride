Look familiar? Your BowTie blog is powered by Jekyll - an easy to use static content generator. You can use this blog like any other Jekyll site. Write markdown, commit and publish.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. To see your changes locally, install the bowtie-io gem and run `bowtie serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated. Your site will be visible at localhost:4000

Your project posts page can be found at “%projectName%/blog/“ by default. To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter (title, permalink, etc.). Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}


BowTie documents features that fall outside of default Jekyll behavior in [Our Documentation](https://bowtie.io/docs#getting-started-bowtie-files).
