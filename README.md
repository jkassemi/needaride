## Setup:

1. Create a BowTie Project
1. Attach backend URL https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/~jkassemi/needaride/public/ to development, master, and beta. This is an installation of the Laravel application at https://github.com/dylan-mcdonald/needaride/. You can host your own backend if you want.
1. Integrate [dashboard.html](https://github.com/jkassemi/needaride/blob/master/dashboard.html). This contains a JS interface to the needaride Laravel application and some examples.
1. Visit your Project
1. Sign up and log in
1. Visit /dashboard/ on your Project Site to check out the API explorer, which is pretty rudimentary, but should get you started.
